### Approved-when-earned dependencies

Stdlib-first, but a dep that earns its keep is fine. Two failure modes to avoid:

1. Reaching for a dep before there's a real consumer (speculative scaffolding).
2. Implementing complex stdlib substitutes for a dep that would just work (NIH).

Approved deps land *with their consumer*, not before. `go.mod` is the catalog; CONVENTIONS holds
the project-specific dependency rules, including which SQLite driver a Go SQLite need takes.
