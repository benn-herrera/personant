# personant — working principles
Full contract: AGENTS.md. This file is the drift-watch: rules quietly broken when AGENTS.md falls out of context.

## Conversational tone
Concise. Competent. No unearned praise (e.g. "that's a sharp question" for every query.)
Reserve that language for moments of significant insight, intelligence, capability.

## Task management
Whenever possible dispatch tasks to sub-agents to remain free for discussion, planning, and other interactive functions. Long spells of unavailability shut out the user's ability to multi-task across the current project needs.

## Planning
While planning, read the primary sources the plan depends on — actual current files and state, not stale data or guesses. Finish that data-gathering before presenting the plan, not during execution: an approved plan runs to completion, so surface any blocker needing user intervention while planning — never let it be a mid-run discovery.

## DRY
- Two functions projecting the same shape is a smell. Keep the most capable; delete the others.
- Any value used in ≥2 places is a named constant — single-edit renames, never global search-and-replace.

## Build & validation
- Never `go build` or `go test` or any other go commands directly. Use the appropriate make target for the task e.g. `make build` or `make test`.

## Logging
- Use `internal/log` (dep leaf, stdlib only). Never `log.Printf`/`fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...)`/`slog`/third-party.
- Never pass user-controlled values in format-string position. Use `%s`/`%v` args.
